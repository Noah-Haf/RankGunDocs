#### Ranking Module Documentation

<Callout type="info" emoji="🎈">
  A documentation all about the Rankgun Ranking Module using the API!
</Callout>

Ever wanted to make your own creation that isn't an application or a rank centre or an official product?
You are in the right place! This documentation tells you all you need to know to get started.

Here we will send the API via roblox script. This sends a request to RankGun which will do what we instruct it to do in the URL
If you ever wanted to see what different types of request you can send to RankGun, then take a look here: https://api.rankgun.works/docs#/

### Example

**When you send a request to RankGun it should be by this script:**

```
--1 Configuration
local workspaceID = ""
local apiToken = ""
local NameOfPlayerToRank = ""

--2 Request
local url = "https://api.rankgun.works/ranking/promote?workspace_id="..workspaceID.."&username="..tostring(NameOfPlayerToRank)
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")
local headers = {
	["api-token"] = apiToken
}

--3 Sending the URL
local success, request = pcall(function()
	return HttpService:RequestAsync({
		Url = url,
		Method = "POST",
		Headers = headers,
	})
end)
--4 Checking if it worked
	if success then
		return print("The player was ranked!")
	elseif not success then
		return print("There was an error ranking the player.")
	end
```

Ok so in the first few lines of code are the variables you need to configure,
Firstly, the workspaceID is what you can find in the URL when you are in your workspace on the website and then you put what your workspaceID is in the speech marks.
Secondly, then apiToken is what you can find in settings in you workspace, you will be able to copy your token then that is what you put in the speech marks.
Thirdly, the variable of who you want to be promoted - this one is optional and there are multiple ways of getting the player's name to rank them.
When this script has been ran, it will promote the player you have listed in the speech marks.

Then the request is the URL you want to send, you can find all different URL's you can use for RankGun here: https://api.rankgun.works/docs#/

The third few lines of code it basically sending the URL and the fourth is checking if it worked. But if the fourth one doesn't show up with a clear output then just delete it as it is no use.

### Explanation

When you are trying to get the player you want to rank, it must be in username form or UserID form.
For example in my ranking commands script:

```
if Words[1] == "!promote" then
				local NameOfPlayerToRank = Words[2]

				local PlayerToRank = game.Players:FindFirstChild(NameOfPlayerToRank)

```

The player I want to rank is the second word of the command I put in chat - "!promote **Fudgerush23**"
This will send a request to RankGun to promote "Fudgerush23"
You will need to get the player's username or UserID somehow when making your own RankGun creation.
This can be from a function, variable etc.

### Changing the URL

## Demoting

You aren't always going to use just the promote function so if you would like to use demote, simple! Just replace the "promote" to "demote" in the URL

## SetRank

When you want to use the SetRank function then you must add another variable which will be called "Rank" this will be the RankID that we want to rakn the player to.
If you are adding this exact script - make sure to add the configurations (workspaceID, apiToken etc.) - those can be found in the promote script.

```
	local url = "https://api.rankgun.works/ranking/set-rank?workspace_id="..workspaceID.."&rank="..tostring(Rank)..	"&username="..tostring(NameOfPlayerToRank)
				local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")
				local headers = {
					["api-token"] = apiToken
				}

				local success, request = pcall(function()
					return HttpService:RequestAsync({
						Url = url,
						Method = "POST",
						Headers = headers,
					})
				end)
```

## Others

I am not going to list all of the different types of functions you can have here because that would be boring but if you would like to find more different types of ranking you can use for RankGun,
then as listed above, visit here: https://api.rankgun.works/docs#/

## After creation

After creating, we reccommend that you send your creation to #api-creations in the discord server,
we cannot wait to see what you have made!
Happy developing!
