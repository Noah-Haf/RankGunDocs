# Rank Commands

Rank Commands are a set of tools that allow you to perform ranking actions (promote, /demote) inside of your Roblox game.

You can download the commands through **[this](https://docs.rankgun.works/assets/RankGunRobloxCommands.zip)** link.

## Setup

Unzip the folder, and put it inside Roblox Studio, and you will end up with something like this: 

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="Workspace" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="RankGunCommands">
      <FileTree.File name="RG_RankCmd_Svr" />
      <FileTree.File name="RG_RankCmd_SPS" />
      <FileTree.File name="RG_RankCmd_RS" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


You then should put each folder inside of ``RankGunCommands`` in its respective service: 

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ServerScriptService" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="RG_RankCmd_Svr" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="StarterPlayerScripts" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="RG_RankCmd_SPS" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ReplicatedStorage" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="RG_RankCmd_RS" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Configuration 


To configure ranking commands open ``main`` and change lines 34-37. 

```lua
local GroupId = Your Group Id
local MinimumRank = The minimum rank in your group that can use ranking commands
local WorkspaceId = Your workspace id 
local ApiKey = Your workspace API key
```

## Usage

In Roblox chat you can use ``/promote`` or ``/demote`` followed by the user you want to promote or demote. 

The commands have auto-completion so you can put the first couple of characters of the player you're trying to rank, the command will never rank somebody who is not in your game and will never rank more than one person per command. 

Example usage: ``/promote Roblox``

## Debugging
