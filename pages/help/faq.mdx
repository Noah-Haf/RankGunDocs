Sometimes people may have put the wrong email when signing up, if so, you will need to open a ticket to delete your account and create a new one with the correct email.

If you have put the correct email but still haven't recieved a verification email then you will need to open a ticket.

# How can I purchase enterprise? 
To purchase enterprise you will need to open a ticket in the chat bubble in the corner of your screen, when opening the ticket you must state that you want to purchase enterprise, then the director will give you a quote for your group.

The quote will decide how much enterprise will cost for your group and the payment is yearly. You will recieve a link in the ticket to purchase the enterprise tier. (If you would like then we can give you the special enterprise role in discord!)
