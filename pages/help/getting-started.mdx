# Getting Started

Welcome to RankGun! We're excited to have you on board. As part of our brand-new help centre, we would be thrilled to guide you on how to get started with RankGun.

## Creating your workspace
After logging into the RankGun Web Panel](https://app.rankgun.works/), you can begin by clicking on "Create Workspace." You will then be prompted to enter your Group Id.

Your Group Id is a number found in your group's URL. For example, if your group's URL is "https://roblox.com/groups/12345/Bla Bla," your workspace Id is "12345."

Once you have entered your Group Id, click "create," and it will take you to your brand new workspace.

## Requesting a bot

The bot is designed to perform all actions inside a group. To request a bot, navigate to Roblox Bot and make your request. Typically, it takes 12 hours to get a bot.

  If your bot takes longer than 12 hours to join, please wait for 24 hours. If it still hasn't joined, feel free to contact support via the chat icon at the bottom right of our screen.

Once the bot joins your group, rank it to a role that has the requested permissions.

## Conclusion
